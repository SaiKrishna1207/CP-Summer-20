Astolfo is bored of staying at home all the time, so he decides to solve a problem to keep himself busy.

Astolfo has an string T , consisting of only lowercase latin letters, which he likes. He defines a special string as a string S , which consists of only lowercase latin letters, and has T  as a substring, i.e., there exist some non-negative integers a  and b  where if we remove  a letters from the start of S  and b letters from the end of S , then S=T.

You are given an integer n  and a string T . You have to help Astolfo in solving his problem by finding the number of special strings of length n. Since this number might be large, compute it modulo 10^9 +7 

Constraints:

1<=n<=10^18

1<=length(T)<=50

Input Format
First-line contains the integer n

Second-line contains the string T

Output Format
Output the number of special strings modulo 10^9+7
