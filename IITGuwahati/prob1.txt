The government of Spain has announced a complete lockdown for the next 15 days effective from tomorrow. Little Arturo went to the mall to fetch everything he'll be needing during this time.
The mall has n different types of items. Every item i has its price per piece pi, importance value per piece vali and number of pieces available numi. Arturo has m euros with him. He can get any non-negative number of pieces of each item, as long as the total cost <=m.
He wants to know the maximum importance value sum he can get with the money he has. Calculate this value.

Constraints:

1<=n<=100

1<=m<=10^5

1<=p_i,val_i,num_i<=1000

Input Format
The first input line contains two integers n and m: the number of different items and the total money.

The next line contains n space-separated integers p_1,p_2,…,p_n: the price of each item.

The next line contains n space separated integers val_1,val_2,…,val_n: the importance value of each item.

The last line contains n space-separated integers num_1,num_2,…,num_n: the number of available pieces of every item.

Output Format
Print one integer: the maximum importance value sum that can be achieved.
